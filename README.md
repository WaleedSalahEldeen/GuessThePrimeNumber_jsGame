# GuessThePrimeNumber_jsGame
## Guess The prime Number Is a game created using pure CSS + HTML + JavaScript dom
it is just a simple game for my personal practice.

But it's still have some basic rules 
> - you gain a +1 score when you guess a right prime number between the two numbers in the top right screen.
> - you gain a +1 life whenever you score +5 points.
> - your life points decreased by 1 whenever you guess a wrong number.
> - you completely lose the game when your life reached 0.
